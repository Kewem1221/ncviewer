# ncviewer
This app has two purposes. The first one is to quickly view what is inside a ".nc" file without coding and getting messy info in the cmdline. The second one is to use satellite images stored in a ".nc" file to detect ocean fronts. Currently, sobel edge detection algorithm and Cayula-Cornillon Algorithm (J. F. Cayula and P. Cornillon, “Edge detection algorithm for SST images,” J. Atmos. Ocean. Technol., vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 67–80, 1992, doi: 10.1175/1520-0426(1992)009&lt;0067:EDAFSI>2.0.CO;2.) are available in the app. Note that the original contour-following algorithm in the Cayula-Cornillon Algorithm is not implemented because it is quite difficult to understand and not really important in front detection.
